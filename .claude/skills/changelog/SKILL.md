## Categories (Keep a Changelog Standard)

| Category | When to Use | Conventional Commit Types |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Added** | New features for users | `feat:` |
| **Changed** | Changes to existing functionality | `feat:` (modifications), `refactor:` (user-visible) |
| **Deprecated** | Features that will be removed | `feat:` with deprecation |
| **Removed** | Features that were removed | `feat:` (breaking) |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes | `fix:` |
| **Security** | Vulnerability patches | `fix:` with security label |

## Language Rules

### Write for the USER, not the developer

**Internal changes that don't affect users should be EXCLUDED** from the changelog. Changelogs are for humans who USE the software.

| Don't Write | Write Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| Refactored database layer | (Skip — internal change) |
| Updated dependencies | Dependencies updated to patch CVE-2026-1234 |
| Fixed bug in parser | Documents with special characters now render correctly |
| Added new API endpoint | You can now retrieve usage metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint |
| Improved performance | Page loads are now 40% faster on large datasets |
| Changed config format | Configuration files now use YAML instead of JSON — see migration guide |

### Sentence patterns

- **Added**: "You can now [do thing] (#issue)" or "New [feature] for [use case] (#issue)"
- **Changed**: "[Thing] now [behaves differently] (#issue)"
- **Fixed**: "[Thing] no longer [breaks in this way] (#issue)"
- **Security**: "Dependencies updated to patch [CVE] (#issue)" or "[Component] no longer exposes [data] (#issue)"
- **Deprecated**: "The [feature/flag] will be removed in [version] — use [alternative] (#issue)"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyse Git History

```bash
# Get commits since last tag
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)..HEAD --oneline --no-merges

# Get tags for version comparison links
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -10

# Check for conventional commit format
git log --oneline -20 | grep -E '^[a-f0-9]+ (feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\(.+\))?:'
```

### Step 2: Classify Changes

For each commit:
1. Parse the conventional commit type
2. Determine if the change is **user-visible**
3. Map to the correct Keep a Changelog category
4. Rewrite the message in user-benefit language
5. Link to the relevant issue/PR number

### Step 3: Group by Version

- If there's no existing CHANGELOG.md, create one with all tagged releases
- If there's an existing one, only add the `[Unreleased]` section
- Always include comparison links at the bottom

### Step 4: Handle Non-Conventional Commits

If the repo doesn't use conventional commits:
1. Analyse the commit message content
2. Check if the commit touches tests, docs, config, or source code
3. Read the diff to understand the nature of the change
4. Classify manually based on the actual change

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't include every commit** — changelogs are curated, not comprehensive
- **Don't include merge commits** — they're noise
- **Don't include internal refactors** — unless they change behaviour
- **Don't use past tense** — "Added" not "We added"
- **Don't duplicate the git log** — add context and user benefit
- **Don't forget comparison links** — they're essential for navigation
