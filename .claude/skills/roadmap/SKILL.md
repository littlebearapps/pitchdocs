## How to Get Involved

We'd love your input on what to build next:

- **Vote on features**: React with :+1: on issues you want prioritised
- **Propose ideas**: [Open a discussion](link)
- **Contribute**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started
- **Report issues**: [File a bug](link)

Items marked :thought_balloon: are especially open to community feedback.
```

## Data Sources

### GitHub Milestones (via `github` MCP)

```
mcp__github__list_issues with milestone filter
```

Use milestones to group features into releases. Each milestone becomes a section.

### GitHub Projects (via `github` MCP)

If the repo uses GitHub Projects (v2), pull items from there:
1. Get project board items
2. Map columns/statuses to roadmap legend
3. Extract issue numbers and titles

### Git Tags

```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -20
```

Map tags to completed milestones. Include completion dates.

### Open Issues with Labels

```bash
# Issues labelled as enhancements/features
gh issue list --label "enhancement" --state open --limit 50
gh issue list --label "feature" --state open --limit 50

# Issues in milestones
gh issue list --milestone "v1.3" --state all
```

## Language Rules

- **Mission statement**: One sentence, present tense, aspirational but concrete
- **Feature descriptions**: Benefit-focused, not implementation-focused
- **Status updates**: Factual, linked to issues/PRs
- **Timeline**: Use quarters (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4), not specific dates (they create pressure and disappointment)
- **Tone**: Transparent, inviting, community-oriented

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't promise specific dates** — use quarters or "upcoming"
- **Don't list every issue** — curate to significant features
- **Don't include internal tasks** — roadmaps are for users
- **Don't forget completed milestones** — they show momentum
- **Don't make it static** — include "last updated" date
- **Don't forget the "get involved" section** — roadmaps are conversation starters
