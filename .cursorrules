# PitchDocs — Cursor Rules

You are working on PitchDocs, a Claude Code plugin that generates marketing-quality repository documentation. This is a pure Markdown project with no code runtime.

## Architecture

- **Skills** (12): `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — reference knowledge loaded on-demand
- **Agent** (1): `.claude/agents/docs-writer.md` — orchestration workflow
- **Rule** (1): `.claude/rules/doc-standards.md` — quality standards (source of truth)
- **Commands** (10): `commands/*.md` — slash command definitions

## Writing Standards

- Australian English (realise, colour, behaviour, licence/license)
- Benefit-driven language: `[Feature] so you can [outcome] — [evidence]`
- 4-question test on every doc: problem solved? usable? credible? linked?
- Progressive disclosure: non-technical first, technical deeper
- Every feature claim must trace to actual code (file path, function, config)

## File Sync Requirements

When adding skills or commands, update all of:
- `README.md` (skills table, commands table, features section)
- `AGENTS.md` (skills table, commands table)
- `llms.txt` (file reference with benefit description)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` (component dropdown)

## Upstream Specs

Pinned in `upstream-versions.json`, checked monthly by `.github/workflows/check-upstream.yml`. Do not bump spec versions without verifying the upstream source.

## GEO Optimisation

Structure docs for AI extraction: crisp top-of-page definitions, one topic per H2, descriptive headings with keywords, comparison tables for "X vs Y" queries, concrete statistics with evidence.
