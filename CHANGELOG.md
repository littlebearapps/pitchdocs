## [1.6.0](https://github.com/littlebearapps/pitchdocs/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0) (2026-02-28)

### Added

- **Numeric quality scoring (0–100)** — `/docs-verify score` rates documentation across 5 dimensions (completeness, structure, freshness, link health, evidence) with A–F grade bands — CI mode exports `PITCHDOCS_SCORE` and `PITCHDOCS_GRADE`, supports `--min-score N` threshold
- **Security scanning for generated docs** — `/docs-verify` detects leaked credentials, internal paths (`/Users/`, `/home/`), and internal hostnames so you can catch accidental exposure before shipping
- **Enhanced link validation** — 4 new detection patterns: case-sensitive path checks, fragment-only anchor validation, redirect chain detection, and relative link resolution from nested docs directories
- **Docs CI workflow** — ready-to-use `.github/workflows/docs-ci.yml` with markdownlint-cli2 and lychee link checking, triggered on Markdown changes and monthly schedule
- **Token budget guidelines** — skill token cost targets (reference <3K, workflow <4K, combined <5K) in `doc-standards` rule, plus token audit check in `/docs-verify` to flag oversized skills
- **Skill version tracking** — all 12 skills carry `version:` and `upstream:` fields in YAML frontmatter for provenance and drift detection
- **Project type auto-detection** — docs-writer agent classifies repos (library, CLI, web-app, API, plugin, docs-site, monorepo) and selects writing tone, hero emphasis, and quick start style automatically
- **Windsurf, Cline, and Gemini CLI context files** — `/ai-context` generates `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`, and `GEMINI.md` alongside existing formats (7 AI context files total, 9 AI tools supported)
- **AGENTS.md spec tracking** — upstream version monitoring for the AGENTS.md v1.0 spec with v1.1 feature watch (8 upstream specs tracked total)
- **Licence embed detection** — pitchdocs-suite validates that verbatim licence text isn't accidentally embedded in skill/rule/context files, and cross-checks manifest `license` field against the LICENSE file

### Changed

- docs-verify skill version bumped to 1.3.0 (quality scoring, enhanced links, security scan, token audit)
- ai-context skill version bumped to 1.1.0 (3 new context file formats, spec tracking)
- doc-standards rule expanded with token budget guidelines section
- docs-writer agent validation now includes security scan checklist items and project type classification
- Plugin keywords updated for v1.6.0

### Fixed

- Licence file extension check — flags `LICENSE.md` (GitHub prefers extensionless `LICENSE` for automatic detection)

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/littlebearapps/pitchdocs/compare/v1.4.1...v1.5.0) (2026-02-26)

### Added

- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation)** — new section in `doc-standards` rule with crisp definitions, atomic sections, concrete statistics, comparison tables, TL;DR blocks, and cross-referencing patterns structured for LLM citation
- **GEO patterns in `public-readme` skill** — first-paragraph-as-definition guidance, comparison table optimisation for "X vs Y" queries, and semantic heading hierarchy enforcement
- **Diataxis framework** in `user-guides` skill — classify docs into tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation quadrants with updated directory layout
- **`ai-context` skill and `/ai-context` command** — generate AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, and .github/copilot-instructions.md from codebase analysis with staleness audit mode
- **`docs-verify` skill and `/docs-verify` command** — validate broken links, stale content (90-day threshold via git blame), llms.txt sync, heading hierarchy, image alt text, badge URLs, and feature coverage with CI-friendly output
- **`launch-artifacts` skill and `/launch` command** — transform README/CHANGELOG into Dev.to articles, Hacker News "Show HN" posts, Reddit posts, Twitter/X threads, awesome list submission PRs, and social preview image guidance
- **`api-reference` skill** — configuration templates and comment conventions for TypeDoc, Sphinx/mkdocstrings, godoc, and rustdoc with language auto-detection
- **AI context files in `pitchdocs-suite` inventory** — AGENTS.md and copilot-instructions.md at Tier 2, CLAUDE.md and .cursorrules at Tier 3
- **Diataxis coverage check in `/docs-audit`** — flags missing documentation quadrants
- **AI context staleness check in `/docs-audit`** — verifies context files match current codebase
- **Documentation verification check in `/docs-audit`** — recommends `/docs-verify` for comprehensive validation
- **Enhanced user guide patterns** — copy-paste-ready code examples, error recovery with collapsible troubleshooting, video/screencast placement guidance, and Diataxis cross-links
- **GitHub Actions docs CI template** — markdownlint + lychee link checking workflow in `docs-verify` skill

### Changed

- `pitchdocs-suite` audit scan now checks for AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, and copilot-instructions.md
- `docs-writer` agent now references 4 additional skills (ai-context, docs-verify, launch-artifacts, api-reference)
- Docs inventory expanded from 17+ to 20+ files across all tiers
- Plugin version bumped to 1.5.0 with new keywords (seo, geo, ai-context, agents-md, diataxis)
