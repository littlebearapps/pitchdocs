> Run `/readme` on any repo. Here's what changes:

### Before

```markdown
# my-project
Install: npm install my-project
Usage: import thing from 'my-project'
License: MIT
```

### After

```markdown
# my-project
Ship production-ready APIs in minutes — type-safe, observable, cost-aware.

## Why my-project?
| Problem | Solution |
| Manual config is error-prone | Zero-config defaults with full override support |

## Features
| Feature | Benefit |
| Automatic retry with backoff | Recover from transient failures without writing retry logic |
| OpenTelemetry tracing built in | Know exactly where requests slow down — traces attached to every handler |

## Quick Start · Contributing · License
```

> Run `/features table` to extract those features directly from your codebase — every benefit traces to actual code.

## 💡 Why PitchDocs?

Most documentation generators produce technically-accurate but dry output. Nobody reads it, nobody gets excited, nobody stars the repo.

PitchDocs generates documentation with a **marketing edge** — docs that answer the reader's real questions:

| Question | How PitchDocs Answers It |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Does this solve my problem? | Benefit-driven feature descriptions, not just specs |
| Can I use it? | Quick start that works in under 5 minutes |
| Who made it? | Badges, contributor counts, credibility signals |
| Where do I learn more? | Cross-linked guides, hub pages, community links |

Every doc follows **progressive disclosure** — non-technical first paragraph, technical details deeper — and every doc **cross-links** to related docs so readers never hit a dead end.

## ⚡ Get Started

```bash
# 1. Add the LBA plugin marketplace (once)
/plugin marketplace add littlebearapps/lba-plugins

# 2. Install PitchDocs
/plugin install pitchdocs@lba-plugins

# 3. Generate a README for any project
/readme
```

## 🤖 Commands

| Command | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `/readme` | Generate or update a marketing-friendly README.md | First impressions that convert browsers to users |
| `/features` | Extract features from code and translate to benefits | Never miss a feature worth documenting |
| `/changelog` | Generate CHANGELOG.md from git history with user-benefit language | Users see what changed for *them*, not your commit log |
| `/roadmap` | Generate ROADMAP.md from GitHub milestones and issues | Show contributors where the project is heading |
| `/docs-audit` | Audit docs completeness, quality, GitHub metadata, visual assets, and npm/PyPI registry config | Catch gaps in files, metadata, images, and package registry fields before you ship |
| `/llms-txt` | Generate llms.txt and llms-full.txt for AI discoverability | AI coding assistants and search engines find and understand your docs |
| `/user-guide` | Generate task-oriented user guides in `docs/guides/` | Readers find answers without reading your source code |

The **docs-writer** agent powers these commands — it scans your codebase, extracts features with evidence, and writes docs that pass the 4-question test.

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Generate a README for the current project
/readme

# Extract features from code and output a benefits table
/features table

# Audit features: what's documented vs what's in the code
/features audit

# Generate the full changelog from all tags
/changelog full

# Audit what docs are missing and auto-generate them
/docs-audit fix

# Generate llms.txt for AI tool discoverability
/llms-txt

# Generate both llms.txt and llms-full.txt
/llms-txt full

# Generate a getting-started user guide
/user-guide getting-started
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Claude Code content filter:** When generating `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, or `LICENSE` files, Claude Code's API may return HTTP 400 due to its server-side content filtering policy. This is a [known upstream issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/2111) that Anthropic considers [expected behaviour](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6195). PitchDocs includes built-in workarounds — the plugin fetches these files from canonical URLs rather than generating them inline. See the `docs-writer` agent's Content Filter Mitigation section for details.
