# /docs-audit

Check what public-facing documentation is missing or needs improvement.

## Behaviour

1. Load the `pitchdocs-suite` skill for the complete inventory
2. Load the `doc-standards` rule for quality criteria
3. Scan the repository for all expected documentation files
4. Quality-check existing documents against the 4-question framework
5. Report findings with severity levels

## Audit Checklist

### Presence Check (Does the file exist?)

| Priority | File | Status |
|----------|------|--------|

| Critical | LICENSE | ? |

| High | .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml | ? |
| High | .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml | ? |
| High | .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md | ? |
| Medium | CHANGELOG.md | ? |
| Medium | CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | ? |

### AI Context Files Check

If the project has AI context files, verify they reflect the current codebase:

- [ ] AGENTS.md references correct language/framework version
- [ ] AGENTS.md key commands are runnable (`test`, `build`, `lint`)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md file paths exist on disk
- [ ] .cursorrules conventions match current linter config
- [ ] .github/copilot-instructions.md patterns are consistent with codebase

Report format:
```
AI Context Files:
  ✓ AGENTS.md — present, references TypeScript + Vitest (matches codebase)
  ⚠ CLAUDE.md — references src/index.ts but file is now src/main.ts
  · .cursorrules — not present (recommend: run /ai-context cursor)
  · .github/copilot-instructions.md — not present (recommend: run /ai-context copilot)
```

### Diataxis Coverage Check

Classify existing docs into Diataxis quadrants and flag gaps:

- [ ] At least one How-to Guide exists (docs/guides/)
- [ ] Tutorial exists for onboarding (docs/tutorials/) — optional for small projects
- [ ] Reference docs exist for public API (docs/reference/ or docs/api/) — if applicable
- [ ] Explanation docs exist for architecture decisions — optional for small projects

Report format:
```
Diataxis Coverage:
  ✓ How-to Guides: 4 docs (getting-started, configuration, deployment, troubleshooting)
  · Tutorials: 0 docs (consider adding for complex onboarding)
  ✓ Reference: 1 doc (api.md)
  · Explanation: 0 docs (consider adding architecture decisions doc)
```

### Documentation Verification Check

If the `docs-verify` skill is loaded, also run:
- [ ] All internal links resolve
- [ ] llms.txt references match files on disk
- [ ] No stale docs (>90 days without update, relative to last commit)
- [ ] Badge URLs return valid responses

Recommend: run `/docs-verify` for the full verification report.

### Quality Check (Is the content good?)

For README.md:
- [ ] Has badges (build, coverage, version, license)
- [ ] First paragraph is non-technical and benefit-focused
- [ ] Has a quickstart section that works
- [ ] Has a features section with benefits (emoji+bold+em-dash bullets or table)
- [ ] Hero has bold one-liner + explanatory sentence (not just a one-liner)
- [ ] Use-case framing with reader context (if "What X Does" section is present)
- [ ] Has contributing/community links
- [ ] Consistent spelling and language
- [ ] Links to user guides (if docs/guides/ exists)

For CONTRIBUTING.md:
- [ ] Matches actual dev workflow (correct commands)
- [ ] Includes prerequisites
- [ ] References conventional commits (if used)
- [ ] Links to issue templates

For CHANGELOG.md:
- [ ] Up to date with latest release
- [ ] Uses Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] Written in user-benefit language
- [ ] Has version comparison links

For docs/guides/:
- [ ] Hub page exists (docs/README.md)
- [ ] Getting started guide exists
- [ ] Guides are linked from README.md
- [ ] Each guide has verification steps

### Feature Coverage Check

Load the `feature-benefits` skill and scan the codebase for feature signals. Compare against README features section:

- [ ] Features table has a benefits column (not just feature names)
- [ ] All listed features have evidence (traceable to code)
- [ ] No major codebase features missing from README
- [ ] At least 3 different benefit categories used
- [ ] No over-documented claims (features listed but no code evidence)

Report format:
```
Feature Coverage: N documented / M detected (X%)

Missing from README:
  - [Feature] — found in [file]

Over-documented:
  - [Claimed feature] — no evidence found
```

### Visual Assets Check

- [ ] README references at least one image or GIF (demo, screenshot, architecture diagram)
- [ ] Referenced image files exist (check relative paths resolve)
- [ ] Images have descriptive alt text for accessibility
- [ ] Social preview image set (remind user: Settings > Social preview, 1280x640)

Report format:
```
Visual Assets:
  ✓ README references 2 images (demo.gif, architecture.svg)
  ⚠ docs/images/demo.gif missing alt text
  · Social preview image — check Settings > Social preview (1280×640)
```

### Repository Metadata Check

Check GitHub repo-level settings that affect discoverability. Read current values:

```bash
gh repo view --json topics,homepageUrl,description
```

- [ ] GitHub topics set (at least 5 relevant topics from the topic suggestion framework)
- [ ] Repository description set (matches README value proposition, under ~350 chars)
- [ ] Website/homepage URL set (docs site, homepage, or package registry)

Report format:
```
Repository Metadata:
  ✓ Topics: typescript, documentation, cli, claude-code, readme-generator (5)
  ✗ Description — not set (suggest: match README one-liner)
  ⚠ Website URL — not set (suggest: docs site or homepage)
```

When `fix` argument is used: suggest specific topics based on the codebase scan from the feature-benefits extraction, and offer to apply them:

```bash
# Suggest and apply
gh repo edit --add-topic <topic1> --add-topic <topic2> ...
gh repo edit --description "<README one-liner>"
gh repo edit --homepage "<docs URL or homepage>"
```

### Package Registry Metadata Check (Conditional)

Load the `package-registry` skill for field inventories and audit checks. This section only applies when the project is published to a package registry.

**Detection:**
```bash
[ -f "package.json" ] && echo "npm project detected"
[ -f "pyproject.toml" ] && echo "PyPI project detected"
```

**npm audit (if package.json exists):**
- [ ] `description` present and matches README value proposition
- [ ] `keywords` present with at least 3 relevant entries
- [ ] `repository` present with correct URL format and case
- [ ] `homepage` set (docs site, project page, or registry page)
- [ ] `license` matches LICENSE file content (SPDX identifier)
- [ ] `types`/`typings` present if TypeScript project (check for tsconfig.json)
- [ ] `files` whitelist present (preferred over .npmignore)
- [ ] README avoids npm-incompatible Markdown features (relative images, Mermaid, footnotes)

**PyPI audit (if pyproject.toml exists):**
- [ ] `[project].description` present and non-empty
- [ ] `[project].readme` configured to point at README.md
- [ ] `[project].keywords` present with at least 3 entries
- [ ] `[project].license` present (SPDX expression preferred per PEP 639)
- [ ] `[project.urls]` uses well-known labels (Homepage, Repository, Documentation, Changelog, Issues)
- [ ] `[project].requires-python` present
- [ ] README avoids PyPI-incompatible Markdown (heading anchors, relative images, GitHub callouts, details/summary)

```
