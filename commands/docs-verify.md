# /docs-verify

Validate that documentation remains accurate, linked, and fresh over time. Catches broken links, stale content, and llms.txt drift before they reach users.

## Behaviour

1. Load the `docs-verify` skill for the verification checks
2. Scan all Markdown files in the repository
3. Run the requested checks (or all checks if no arguments)
4. Report findings with severity levels

## Arguments

- **No arguments**: Run all checks and report findings
- `links`: Link validation only (internal + external)
- `freshness`: Staleness check only (git blame-based)
- `ci`: All checks, output in CI-friendly format (exit code 1 on errors, file:line format)
- `score`: Run all checks and output the quality score only
- `--min-score N`: Fail if the quality score falls below N (useful for CI gates)

## Checks Performed

| Check | What It Catches |
|-------|----------------|
| Markdown lint | Heading hierarchy skips, single H1 rule, formatting |
| Link validation | Broken relative paths, dead external URLs, missing anchors |
| llms.txt sync | Files referenced in llms.txt that no longer exist, orphaned docs |
| Image validation | Missing image files, empty alt text, relative URLs for npm/PyPI projects |
| Freshness | Docs not updated in 90+ days (configurable via git blame) |
| Feature coverage | README features vs actual code — undocumented and over-documented |
| Badge URLs | Shields.io badges returning errors or outdated formats |
| Token audit | Skill files exceeding recommended token budgets |
| Quality score | Numeric 0–100 score across 5 dimensions with grade band and actionable fix suggestions |
