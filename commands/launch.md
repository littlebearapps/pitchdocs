# /launch

Transform your README and CHANGELOG into platform-specific posts for launching or announcing your project. Every artifact is derived from existing code and documentation — no generic marketing.

## Behaviour

1. Load the `launch-artifacts` skill for platform templates
2. Load the `feature-benefits` skill for feature extraction (if not already done)
3. Read README.md and CHANGELOG.md for source content
4. Generate the requested artifact(s) from the source content
5. Write artifacts to `docs/launch/` directory (not committed by default — review before posting)

## Arguments

- **No arguments**: Generate all applicable launch artifacts
- `devto`: Dev.to article only
- `hn`: Hacker News "Show HN" post only
- `reddit`: Reddit post templates only
- `social`: Social preview image guidance + Twitter/X thread
- `awesome`: Awesome list submission PR template (searches for relevant awesome lists)

## Output

Generated artifacts are written to `docs/launch/`:

```
docs/launch/
├── devto-article.md          # Dev.to article with frontmatter
├── hackernews-post.md         # HN title + first comment
├── reddit-post.md             # Reddit posts for relevant subreddits
├── twitter-thread.md          # 5-tweet thread
├── awesome-list-submission.md # PR template for awesome list submissions
└── social-preview-guide.md    # Social preview image specifications
```

```
